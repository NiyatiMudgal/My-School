                <p>Education is a social vehicle, which must forge ahead and be a source of new ideas. 
                        The school thus endeavours to provide the right opportunities and environment for the 
                        harmonious development of the personality of the student by giving a thorough and general 
                        education and also conserving the cultural heritage of the country.

                        The School Emblem depicts "GODDESS SARASWATI" the Goddess of Wisdom and Knowledge .
                        Our motto "Wisdom Is Glory" clearly highlights the mission of our school, i.e. to spread the light
                        of Wisdom. We believe in developing the character, confidence and creativity of students, so that 
                        they are equipped to deal with any situation they come across. As such, we are deeply committed to the 
                        teaching learning process, which is a part of every school. Our mission is to nurture each child, just
                         as a sapling is nurtured to enable it to grow into a strong and healthy tree. With the right
                          foundation, we are sure that our students will grow up to be confident young individuals, the truly
                           global citizens of tomorrow.                       
                        
                        The Gyan Devi Group of Schools is run by The Colonelâ€™s Education Society which was founded in
                         the year 1983 by Late Lt. Col. Kunwar Jaswant Singh. The founding father of our school, he was a 
                         visionary par excellence. He had great dreams for the school, which we shall always endeavour
                          to fulfil.                                                 
                        
                        The foundation stone of Gyan Devi Public School Senior Secondary Sector-17 was laid on February 15,
                         1992 by Late Smt. Gyana Devi w/o Late Maj. JNS Yadava. Her blessings and good wishes have been 
                         instrumental in the overall development of the school, and will continue to be a source of
                          inspiration in the years to come.</p>
